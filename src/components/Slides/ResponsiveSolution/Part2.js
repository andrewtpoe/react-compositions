# What does an element resize listener mean?

- We can add an event listener to an HTML Element rendered by a React component.
- We can use React's lifecycle methods to manage the event listener.
- We can define specific size breakpoints for the visual component we want to be responsive.
- We can use React's \`context\` to pass the size down to all of a React component's children.
